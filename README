What is wayland-tracer

wayland-tracer is a protocol dumper for Wayland. It can be used to
trace what's on the wire between the compositor and client.

Building wayland-tracer

Building wayland-tracer is quite simple, it doesn't have many
dependencies, it even doesn't require libwayland (although it borrows
some code from that).

    $ git clone https://github.com/dboyan/wayland-tracer.git
    $ cd wayland-tracer
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=PREFIX
    $ make
    $ make install

and you have wayland-tracer.

Using wayland-tracer

To use wayland-tracer, you first need to have a running wayland
compositor. You can use it to trace single or multiple clients under
that. See the output of `wayland-tracer -h` for details.
